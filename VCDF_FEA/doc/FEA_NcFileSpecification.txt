VisCDF FEA File Specification - Version 1.0
---------------------------------------------
The following is NetCDF file specification for loading and saving FEA data through VisCDF.

* Root Group
	- Attributes: (Optional)
	- Dimensions: (Optional)
	- Variables: (Optional)
	
	* mesh Group - Stores the node and element structure
		- Attributes: (Optional)
		- Dimensions: (Optional)
		- Variables: (Optional)
		
		* part Group - Can have as many part groups as desired and can be named anything
			- Attributes: (Optional)
			- Dimensions:
				nodeNo - Number of nodes (vertices)
				coordinate - This number should be 3 = (x,y,z)
				elementNo - Number of elements (i.e. hexahedra, tetrahedra, etc...)
				connectivity - Defines the type of element (i.e. hexahedron = 8, tetrahedra = 4)
			- Variables
				float nodes(nodeNo, coordinate) - The node data (vertices)
				int elements(elementNo, connectivity) - The elements (each int represents an index for the nodes)
    
    * results Group - The results of the fea simulation
		- Attributes: (Optional)
		- Dimensions: (Optional)
		- Variables: (Optional)
    	
    	* result set Group - Can have as many simulation groups as desired and can be named anything
			- Attributes: (Optional)
			- Dimensions: (Optional)
			- Variables: (Optional)
    	
    		* frame Group - Represents a time step frame.  Can have many frame groups as desired and
    							must be named "frame_"<frame number> (i.e. frame_0, frame_1, etc...)
    			- Attributes: (Optional)
				- Dimensions:
					time - Must be equal to 1 and is for getting the stepTime value
				- Variables: (Optional)
					float stepTime(time) - The time step that the frame represents
					
				* part Group - Cooresponds the the mesh group described mesh group and must be named the same
					- Attributes: (Optional)
					- Dimensions:
						nodeNo - Number of nodes (vertices)
						Tensor_U - Used for displacement (U)
						(Optional Dimensions for other variables)
					- Variables:
						float U(nodeNo, Tensor_U) - The displacement data for the part
						(Optional variables) - Other variables can be named anything, but the first dimension
